# Linuxinstall of Thies


`assets/` directory contains files from different repo's with very slight changes. Sources are on the top of the file


## TODO
- [ ] Create ~/prod ~/dev ~/school directory's (Or similiar folder structure)
- [ ] Auto github key upload?  
    - Would be handy, but maybe secure SSH key storage to just copy old key
    - Also add GPG key import/generation
- [ ] Auto apply gnome config https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-gnome-shell-extensions-from-zip-file-using-command-line-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux
- [ ] Add spicetify
- [ ] Launch the ZSH shell and execute the NVM & pyenv install commands (https://stackoverflow.com/a/18756584)
- [ ] Install chatterino
